.SH NAME
\fBssh-keysign\fP
\- OpenSSH helper for host-based authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
\fBssh-keysign\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBssh-keysign\fP
is used by
\fBssh\fP(1)
to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature
required during host-based authentication.

\fBssh-keysign\fP
is disabled by default and can only be enabled in the
global client configuration file
\fI/system/etc/ssh/ssh_config\fP
by setting
\fBEnableSSHKeysign\fP
to
``yes''.

\fBssh-keysign\fP
is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
\fBssh\fP(1).
See
\fBssh\fP(1)
and
\fBsshd\fP(8)
for more information about host-based authentication.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /system/etc/ssh/ssh_config
Controls whether
\fBssh-keysign\fP
is enabled.

These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to
generate the digital signature.
They should be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
Since they are readable only by root,
\fBssh-keysign\fP
must be set-uid root if host-based authentication is used.

If these files exist they are assumed to contain public certificate
information corresponding with the private keys above.
