.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsftp\fP
is a file transfer program, similar to
\fBftp\fP(1),
which performs all operations over an encrypted
\fBssh\fP(1)
transport.
It may also use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and
compression.

The
\fIdestination\fP
may be specified either as
[user@]host[:path]
or as a URI in the form
sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path.]

If the
\fIdestination\fP
includes a
\fIpath\fP
and it is not a directory,
\fBsftp\fP
will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive
authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after
successful interactive authentication.

If no
\fIpath\fP
is specified, or if the
\fIpath\fP
is a directory,
\fBsftp\fP
will log in to the specified
\fIhost\fP
and enter interactive command mode, changing to the remote directory
if one was specified.
An optional trailing slash can be used to force the
\fIpath\fP
to be interpreted as a directory.

Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host
names from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be
enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity.

The options are as follows:
.TP
\fB\-4\fP
Forces
\fBsftp\fP
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.TP
\fB\-6\fP
Forces
\fBsftp\fP
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than overwriting
existing partial or complete copies of files.
If the partial contents differ from those being transferred,
then the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.
.TP
\fB\-B\fP \fIbuffer_size\fP
Specify the size of the buffer that
\fBsftp\fP
uses when transferring files.
Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher
memory consumption.
The default is 32768 bytes.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP \fIbatchfile\fP
Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input
\fIbatchfile\fP
instead of
.IR stdin .
Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with
non-interactive authentication to obviate the need to enter a password
at connection time (see
\fBsshd\fP(8)
and
\fBssh-keygen\fP(1)
for details).

A
\fIbatchfile\fP
of
`\-'
may be used to indicate standard input.
\fBsftp\fP
will abort if any of the following
commands fail:
\fBget\fP, \fBput\fP, \fBreget\fP, \fBreput\fP, \fBrename\fP, \fBln\fP,
\fBrm\fP, \fBmkdir\fP, \fBchdir\fP, \fBls\fP,
\fBlchdir\fP, \fBchmod\fP, \fBchown\fP,
\fBchgrp\fP, \fBlpwd\fP, \fBdf\fP, \fBsymlink\fP,
and
\fBlmkdir\fP.

Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command basis by
prefixing the command with a
`\-'
character (for example,
\fB-rm /tmp/blah* )\fP.
Echo of the command may be suppressed by prefixing the command with a
`@'
character.
These two prefixes may be combined in any order, for example
\fB-@ls /bsd\fP.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Enables compression (via ssh's
\fB\-C\fP
flag).
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcipher\fP
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fIsftp_server_path\fP
Connect directly to a local sftp server
(rather than via
\fBssh\fP(1)) .
This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP \fIssh_config\fP
Specifies an alternative
per-user configuration file for
\fBssh\fP(1).
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after transfer.
When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if the server
implements the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIidentity_file\fP
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key
authentication is read.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-J\fP \fIdestination\fP
Connect to the target host by first making an
\fBsftp\fP
connection to the jump host described by
\fIdestination\fP
and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from
there.
Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.
This is a shortcut to specify a
\fBProxyJump\fP
configuration directive.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlimit\fP
Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIssh_option\fP
Can be used to pass options to
\fBssh\fP
in the format used in
\fBssh_config\fP(5).
This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate
\fBsftp\fP
command-line flag.
For example, to specify an alternate port use:
\fBsftp -oPort=24\fP.

This option is also passed to ssh.
.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Once in interactive mode,
\fBsftp\fP
understands a set of commands similar to those of
\fBftp\fP(1).
Commands are case insensitive.
Pathnames that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotes.
Any special characters contained within pathnames that are recognized by
\fBglob\fP(3)
must be escaped with backslashes
(`\e'.)
.TP
\fBbye\fP
Quit
\fBsftp\fP.

flag is specified, then symlinks will not be followed.
\fIpath\fP
may contain
\fBglob\fP(7)
characters and may match multiple files.
\fIgrp\fP
must be a numeric GID.
.TP
\fBchmod\fP [\fB\-h\fP] \fImode\fP \fIpath\fP

(or
\fIpath\fP
if specified).
If the
\fB\-h\fP
flag is specified, the capacity information will be displayed using
"human-readable" suffixes.
The
\fB\-i\fP
flag requests display of inode information in addition to capacity information.
This command is only supported on servers that implement the
``statvfs@openssh.com''
extension.
.TP
\fBexit\fP
Quit
\fBsftp\fP.
.TP
\fBget\fP [\fB\-afPpr\fP] \fIremote-path\fP [\fIlocal-path\fP]

If the local
path name is not specified, it is given the same name it has on the
remote machine.
\fIremote-path\fP
may contain
\fBglob\fP(7)
characters and may match multiple files.
If it does and
\fIlocal-path\fP
is specified, then
\fIlocal-path\fP
must specify a directory.

If the
\fB\-a\fP
flag is specified, then attempt to resume partial transfers of existing files.
Note that resumption assumes that any partial copy of the local file matches
the remote copy.
If the remote file contents differ from the partial local copy then the
resultant file is likely to be corrupt.

If the
\fB\-f\fP
flag is specified, then
\fBfsync\fP(2)
will be called after the file transfer has completed to flush the file
to disk.

If either the
\fB\-P\fP
or
\fB\-p\fP
flag is specified, then full file permissions and access times are

a hard link.
.TP
\fBlpwd\fP
Print local working directory.
.TP
\fBls\fP [\fB\-1afhlnrSt\fP] [\fIpath\fP] 
Display a remote directory listing of either
\fIpath\fP
or the current directory if
\fIpath\fP
is not specified.
\fIpath\fP
may contain

on the local machine.
\fIlocal-path\fP
may contain
\fBglob\fP(7)
characters and may match multiple files.
If it does and
\fIremote-path\fP
is specified, then
\fIremote-path\fP
must specify a directory.

transfers of existing files.
Note that resumption assumes that any partial copy of the remote file
matches the local copy.
If the local file contents differ from the remote local copy then
the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.

If the
\fB\-f\fP
flag is specified, then a request will be sent to the server to call
\fBfsync\fP(2)
after the file has been transferred.
Note that this is only supported by servers that implement
the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.

If either the
\fB\-P\fP
or
\fB\-p\fP
