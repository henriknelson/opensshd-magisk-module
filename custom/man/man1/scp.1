.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscp\fP
copies files between hosts on a network.
It uses
\fBssh\fP(1)
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
\fBssh\fP(1).
\fBscp\fP
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.

The
\fIsource\fP
and
\fItarget\fP
may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host with optional path
in the form
[user@]host:[path,]
or a URI in the form
scp://[user@]host[:port][/path.]
Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames
to avoid
\fBscp\fP
treating file names containing
`:\&'
as host specifiers.

When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a
\fIport\fP
may only be specified on the
\fItarget\fP
if the
\fB\-3\fP
option is used.

The options are as follows:
.TP
\fB\-3\fP
Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host.
Without this option the data is copied directly between the two remote
hosts.
Note that this option disables the progress meter.
.TP
\fB\-4\fP
Forces
\fBscp\fP
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.TP
\fB\-6\fP
Forces
\fBscp\fP
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.TP
\fB\-B\fP
Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Compression enable.
Passes the
\fB\-C\fP
flag to
\fBssh\fP(1)
to enable compression.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcipher\fP
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-F\fP \fIssh_config\fP
Specifies an alternative
per-user configuration file for
\fBssh\fP.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIidentity_file\fP
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key
authentication is read.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-J\fP \fIdestination\fP
Connect to the target host by first making an
\fBscp\fP
connection to the jump host described by
\fIdestination\fP
and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from
there.
Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.
This is a shortcut to specify a
\fBProxyJump\fP
configuration directive.
This option is directly passed to
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlimit\fP
Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIssh_option\fP
Can be used to pass options to
\fBssh\fP
in the format used in
\fBssh_config\fP(5).
This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate
\fBscp\fP
command-line flag.
For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
\fBssh_config\fP(5).

\fB\-P\fP \fIport\fP
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
Note that this option is written with a capital
`P',
because
\fB\-p\fP
is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic
messages from
\fBssh\fP(1).
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
Recursively copy entire directories.
Note that
\fBscp\fP
follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIprogram\fP
Name of
\fIprogram\fP
to use for the encrypted connection.
The program must understand
\fBssh\fP(1)
options.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Disable strict filename checking.
By default when copying files from a remote host to a local directory
\fBscp\fP
checks that the received filenames match those requested on the command-line
to prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files.
Because of differences in how various operating systems and shells interpret
filename wildcards, these checks may cause wanted files to be rejected.
This option disables these checks at the expense of fully trusting that
the server will not send unexpected filenames.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Verbose mode.
Causes
\fBscp\fP
and
\fBssh\fP(1)
to print debugging messages about their progress.
This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
